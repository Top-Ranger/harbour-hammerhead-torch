# Hammerhead Torch
A simple torch app, originally written for the LG Nexus 5 (codename "hammerhead") port of Sailfish OS.

Hammerhead Torch now automatically detects Hammerhead and the Jolla Phone, and can be easily made to support any other phone with an LED that can be controlled using a simple switch file (i.e. file contents 1 for on, 0 for off).

Please contact me if you are running Sailfish on different hardware, and I will add auto-detection support for your device.
